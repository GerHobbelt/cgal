\cgalHeading{How to use BGL Optional Named Parameters}

The notion of named parameters was introduced in the BGL.
Details can be found from: https://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/bgl_named_params.html.
Named parameters enable the user to specify only those parameters which are really needed, by name, making the parameter ordering not required.
See also \ref bgl_namedparameters.

The sequence of named parameters should start with `CGAL::parameters::`.
The function `#all_default()` can be used to indicate
that default values of optional named parameters are used.

\cgalHeading{List of Available Named Parameters}

In this package, functions optional parameters are implemented as BGL optional named parameters and listed below.

In the following, we assume that the following types are provided as template parameters of tetrahedral remeshing
functions. Note that the type may be more specific for some functions.

<ul>
<li>`Triangulation` implements a `Triangulation_3` with specific vertex base and cell base.</li>
</ul>

\cgalNPTableBegin

\cgalNPBegin{number_of_iterations} \anchor Remeshing_number_of_iterations
the number of iterations for the full sequence of atomic operations
(edge splits, edge collapses, edge flips, smoothing and projection to the initial surface)
performed to reach the input target edge length while improving the quality of dihedral angles
in the mesh.\n
\b Type : `std::size_t` \n
\b Default value is `1`
\cgalNPEnd

\cgalNPBegin{protect_boundaries} \anchor Remeshing_protect_boundaries
a boolean that states whether the boudaries should be modified by the remeshing
process. Boundaries are between the exterior and the interior,
between two subdomains, and between the areas selected or not for remeshing
(cf \ref \Remeshing_cell_selector). If `true` they cannot.\n
\b Type : `bool` \n
\b Default value is `true`
\cgalNPEnd

\cgalNPBegin{cell_selector} \anchor Remeshing_cell_selector
a functor that takes a `Cell_handle` as parameter and returns a `bool` that states whether
a cell is part of the zone to the remeshed. Unselected cells will not be modified by
the remeshing algorithm.\n
\b Type : Unary function object with `Cell_handle` as argument type and `bool` as return type.\n
\b Default value is a function object that always returns `true`.
